# ðŸŒ€ corkscrew

Declaratively build and execute http requests.

> This is my first ever project in Rust. No doubt, doing some things poorly. Happy to receive constructive suggestions in [issues](https://github.com/nixpig/corkscrew/issues).

## Examples

**Execute all requests in `hosts.yml` file:**

```shell
corkscrew
  # => get request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1
  # => get request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=1
  # => post request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts with body { title, body, userId }
```

**Execute specific requests in `requests.yml` file:**

```shell
corkscrew -f requests.yml get_comments
  # => get request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments?postId=1
```

```yaml
# hosts.yml
- name: example
  host: example.com
  requests:
    - name: get_posts
      resource: /posts/1

    - name: get_comments
      resource: /comments
      params:
        postId: 1

    - name: create_post
      resource: /posts
      method: !post
      auth: !bearer
        token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MDAyMDU4MjIsImlzX2FkbWluIjpmYWxzZSwidXNlcl9pZCI6Mn0.1uKA2rzEoOajZ5bBnxes9XIUo2iOwKCD7bVVwvRzJ48
      body:
        title: Lorem ipsum
        body: Lorem ipsum dolar sit amet.
        userId: 1

    - name: update_post_title
      resource: /posts/1
      method: !patch
      auth: !basic
        username: corks
        password: p4ssw0rd
      body:
        title: Dolar sit
```

## Installation

## API

Currently implemented. This is a work in progress and open to change.

```yaml
- name: # name of the host (can be any string, it's not used to build the actual request)
  host: # the host to which to make a request, e.g. example.com
  scheme: Optional<http|https> # the scheme to use, e.g. https (default: http)
  port: Optional<number> # the port to use
  timeout: Optional<number> # number of seconds before timing out (default: 30)
  requests:
    - name: Required<string> # the name of the request, e.g. get_user_by_id
      resource: Required<string> # that resource to request, e.g. /api/user
      method: Optional<Enum<!get|!post|!put|!patch|!delete> # the http method to use, e.g. !post (default: !get)

      # Optional request parameters
      params:
        # <parameter_name>: <parameter_value>
        name: value

      # Optional body content (parsed to JSON)
      body:
        name: value # <property_name>: <property_value>
        # also supports nested JSON structures
        l1_name1: l1_value1
        l1_name2:
          l2_name1: l2_value1
          l2_name2:
            l3_name1: l3_value1
            l3_name2: l3_value2

      # Optional headers
      headers:
        # <header_name>: <header_value>
        name: value
```

## Motivation

I wanted a way to define project-specific REST API requests to quickly and easily execute from the command-line.

## Alternatives

There are a bunch of other solutions for making REST API requests.

I've tried most of these in the past, but they didn't quite fit into my workflow as I needed. They may well work for you, in which case, don't worry!

| Name    | Type | Challenges                                                                                              |
| ------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| cURL    | CLI  | Depending on the approach, either searching through shell history or maintaining lots of `.http` files. |
| Postman | GUI  | GUI apps don't fit well into my workflow. JSON is a pain to maintain.                                   |

Yes, I've also tried _{insert favourite util here}_, raw-dogging `ncat` requests, and everything in between.

## Contribute

This is a personal project for me to learn Rust and is not currently open for contributions.

This may change in the future.
